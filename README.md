Programming assignments and lecture notes of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) 
taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) and offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on Coursera. 

This repository contains my work on the assignmnents. The codebase and lecture
notes are taken from the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.
