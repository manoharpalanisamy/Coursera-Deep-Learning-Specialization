## Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
The third course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on learning how to build a successful machine learning project and practicing decision making as a machine learning project leader.

### Week 1: ML Strategy (1)
Streamline and optimize a ML production workflow by implementing strategic guidelines for goal-setting and applying human-level performance to help define key priorities.

- Explain why Machine Learning strategy is important
- Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up goals for ML projects
- Select the correct train/dev/test split for a dataset
- Define human-level performance
- Use human-level performance to define key priorities in ML projects
- Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset

[Lecture Notes][L1]  

### Week 2: ML Strategy (2)
Develop time-saving error analysis procedures to evaluate the most worthwhile options to pursue and gain intuition for how to split data and when to use multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning. 

- Describe multi-task learning and transfer learning
- Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of the algorithm on train/dev/test sets
