## Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
The first course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on the foundational concepts of neural networks and deep learning.

### Week 1: Introduction to Deep Learning
Understand the significant technological trends driving deep learning development and where and how itâ€™s applied.

- Discuss the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
- Explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning
- List the major categories of models (CNNs, RNNs, etc.), and when they should be applied
- Assess appropriate use cases for deep learning

[Lecture Notes][L1]  

### Week 2: Neural Networks Basics
Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up models.

- Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization implemetation (gradient descent)
- Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models
- Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset
- Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations
- Work with iPython Notebooks
- Implement vectorization across multiple training examples
- Explain the concept of broadcasting

### Week 3: Shallow Neural Networks
Build a neural network with one hidden layer using forward propagation and backpropagation.

- Describe hidden units and hidden layers
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
- Implement forward and backward propagation
